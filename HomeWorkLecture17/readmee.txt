Early and personal life
Novak Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to Dijana (née Žagar) and Srdjan Djokovic. 
He is of paternal Serbian and maternal Croatian descent.[15] His two younger brothers, Marko and Djordje, have also played 
professional tennis.[16]

Djokovic began playing tennis at the age of four,[17] after his parents gave him a mini-racket and a soft foam ball, which 
his father claimed became "the most beloved toy in his life".[18] His parents then sent him to a tennis camp in Novi Sad.[18][19] I
n the summer of 1993, as a six-year-old, he was sent to a tennis camp organized by the Teniski Klub Partizan[19] and overseen by 
Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Genčić[20] at Mount Kopaonik, where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food parlour[21] and a sports 
equipment business.[18] Upon seeing the child Djokovic playing tennis, she stated: "This is the greatest talent I have seen since 
Monica Seles."[19]Genčić worked with young Djokovic over the following six years before realizing that, owing to his rapid development,
going abroad in search of an increased level of competition was the best option for his future. To that end, she contacted Nikola Pilić
and in September 1999 the 12-year-old moved to the Pilić tennis academy in Oberschleißheim, Germany, spending four years there.[22] At 
the age of 14, he began his international career, winning European championships in singles, doubles, and team competition.[23]
Djokovic is a self-described fan of languages, speaking Serbian, English, French, German, and Italian.[24][25]
